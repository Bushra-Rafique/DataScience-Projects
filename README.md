# DataScience-Projects
This repository contains five hands-on projects focused on data visualization, classification, and regression. Each task demonstrates different techniques in **data preprocessing, modeling, and visual storytelling** using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

## Task Overview

### Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset:
- **Objective:** Load and visualize the Iris dataset to understand variable distributions and relationships.
- **Dataset:** Iris Dataset (from Seaborn)
- **Key Actions:**
  - Display structure with `.shape`, `.columns`, `.head()`
  - Visualize using scatter plot, histogram, and box plot
- **Skills:** Data inspection, summarization, and basic plotting

### Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction:
- **Objective:** Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default.
- **Dataset:** Loan Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Key Actions:**
  - Handle missing data (mode, median)
  - Visualize income, education, and loan amount
  - Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
  - Evaluate with accuracy and confusion matrix
- **Skills:** Data cleaning, binary classification, EDA, model evaluation

### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction (Bank Customers):
- **Objective:** Identify bank customers who are likely to churn.
- **Dataset:** Churn Modelling Dataset
- **Key Actions:**
  - Encode categorical features (Label Encoding, One-Hot)
  - Train a classification model
  - Analyze feature importance
- **Skills:** Categorical encoding, supervised learning, interpretability

### Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts:
- **Objective:** Estimate insurance claim costs using regression.
- **Dataset:** Medical Cost Personal Dataset
- **Key Actions:**
  - Train a Linear Regression model
  - Visualize impact of BMI, age, and smoking on charges
  - Evaluate using MAE and RMSE
- **Skills:** Regression modeling, feature correlation, error analysis

### Task 5: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction:
- **Objective:** Predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer.
- **Dataset:** Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI ML Repository)
- **Key Actions:**
  - Explore features like job, age, and marital status
  - Train a Logistic Regression or Decision Tree model
  - Analyze which groups are more likely to accept
- **Skills:** Classification, customer segmentation, business insight extraction

## Tech Stack:
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
